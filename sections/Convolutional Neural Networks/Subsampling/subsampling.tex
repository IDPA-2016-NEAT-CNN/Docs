Subsampling is, broadly speaking, the act of taking values from a source, observing them and combining these into a smaller dataset that is still representative.  

It's a bit like compressing, really.  

Traditional use cases of subsampling include the JPEG format, which makes use of the fact that the human eye cannot differentiate colors as good as luminance, and simplifies parts of the image that are not differentiable for the average human anyways. \cite{BrandenLambrecht2001}
