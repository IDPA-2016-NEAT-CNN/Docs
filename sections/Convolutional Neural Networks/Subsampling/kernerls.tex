The subsampling CNNs perform is not related specifically to the human eye but animal visual systems in general.  \cite{MasakazuMatsugu2003}  

The main goal of a CNN is to "see" structures in images.  
These can be geometric (line, square, circle, etc.),  
typical human recognitions (face, smile, house, cat),  
and also totally inhuman and unintuitive structures (wiggly lines pointing to the left, three stripes ending up in a sharp point)

Enter kernels.  \\
Kernels are little matrices that go through an image and filter a certain structure out of it as they multiply their weights with the individual pixels. Because of this behavior, they are sometimes referred to as \emph{filters}.
