Even though the kernels do a great job at making the image smaller, the resulting data is still to big to work with.  
For this reason one can use poolers, with are nothing but dumb compression algorithms. 
 
The most used pooler is the max pooler. \cite{Graham2014}  \\
This simple unit traditionally takes four adjacent pixels, determines the darkest one, and simply concatenates the four original pixels into this smaller single one.  
Repeat this process over the whole image, and you just scaled it to one fourth of it's original size.
