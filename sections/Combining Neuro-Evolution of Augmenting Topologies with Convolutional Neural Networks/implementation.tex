While programming according to our algorithm, we continuously tested our code.\\
We unfortunately found out during one of those tests, that our implementation of matrix multiplication while applying a filter is not nearly fast enough to process high quality scans of mammographies.

A simple test with 32 by 32 images confirmed our fear: Deep networks with a dimensionality higher than 10 are not realistically computable in a given time. By contrast, the deepest ResNet uses more than 1000 dimensioniona in its lowest layers. Given that genetic algorithms go even further by not training one network, but 100 at a time, and considering our limited time, we had to halt further research.
