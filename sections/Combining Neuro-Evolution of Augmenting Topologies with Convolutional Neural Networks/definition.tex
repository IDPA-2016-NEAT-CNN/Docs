Residual Blocks are modular by nature, so they are a perfect fit for our NEAT algorithm.\\
When analyzing them, we can easily extract following parameters from them:\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Weights of first dimension pooler}
	\item{Weights of convolution pooler}
	\item{Weights of second dimension pooler}
	\item{Downscaled number of dimensions in each residual block}
	\item{Upscaled number of dimensions in each residual block}
	\item{Number of convolutions in each residual block}
	\item{Total number of residual blocks}
\end{enumerate}  
Through traditional means we can adjust the parameters 1 to 3. \\
Numbers 4 to 7 are predefined in ResNet. 
Their exact values are defined empirically and experimentally. This is of course suboptimal, as we already asserted in chapter two.\\
We think NEAT can optimize these by encoding them as genes in the genome. \\
However, because of the nature of our smallest building blocks
