CLion is an integrated development environment for C++ developers. \cite{clion} \\
We decided to use it over other available tools because it is the best tool available for macOS and Linux and we felt like we wouldn't get any productivity raise otherwise after trying several other IDEs.

One of the problem with CLion is that it is not up-to-date with all of the latest developments in the C++ programming language. This makes it almost impossible to use it for modern C++ development. 

We then even started using plain text editors in edge cases on Linux to not be limited by the editor and compile our code with the new C++ features with compiler that we accessed via the command-line
\cite{clionstatus}

This was only a problem on Linux and maxOS, because for Windows, the very well known Visual Studio IDE is available, which supports the features we wanted in a release candidate that is publicly available.
