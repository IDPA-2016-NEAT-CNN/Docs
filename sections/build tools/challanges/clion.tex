CLion is an integrated development environment for C++ developers. \cite{clion} \\
We had to use it, because it is the best tool available for macOS and Linux.

The problem with it is, that it is not up-to-date with the latest developments in the C++ programming language.This makes it almost impossible to use for modern C++ development. Our conclusion was that we would use plain text editors for now together with the new C++ features. Later we can switch to CLion, as it will receive support for the new features later on. \cite{clionstatus}
