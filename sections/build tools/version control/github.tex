GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. \cite{github} \\
This means for us, that we have a central place where our data is located. This also enables us to simultaneously work on the code, which increases the speed of development.  

GitHub provides all services for free when developing an open-source application. \cite{githubprice}
