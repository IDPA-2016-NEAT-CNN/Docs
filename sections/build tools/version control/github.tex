GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. \cite{github} \\
This means for us, that we have a central place where our data is located. This also enables us to simultaneously work on the code, which increases the speed of development.  

GitHub provides all services for free when developing an open-source application. \cite{githubprice}  

We use some of the GitHub features to improve the quality of our documentation. We have set it up, so that any change to the documentation has to happen on a new branch and before it gets copied over to the main one, another member of the team has to approve the changes. \cite{githubreviews}
