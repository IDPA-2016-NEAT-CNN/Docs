Git is a version control system that was first proposed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. \cite{Torvalds} \\
It is a free, open-source version control system, which we use for our entire source code and documentation.

We first separated our code into multiple repositories \cite{gitrepo} as we thought it would make sense to keep NEAT and CNN separated. Later we decided that it would make more sense to keep everything in a single repository, as we had to use both parts simultaneously.

A repository is like a project folder, but it is synced across multiple computers.
