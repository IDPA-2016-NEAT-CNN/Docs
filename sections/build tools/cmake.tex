CMake is a tool to control the software compilation and testing process. \cite{cmake} \\
It allows us to write a fairly simple configuration file which can then be used on multiple platforms.
It is a high level configuration that has to be converted into a platform specific one.

This allows us to support almost every operating system, as it was important for us the be platform independent. \\
The problem with platform dependent solutions is, that they are not as accessible to everyone and we really want to support all major operating systems.
