CMake is a tool to control processes of software compilation and testing. \cite{cmake} \\
It allows us to write a fairly simple configuration file which can then be used on multiple platforms.
It is a high level configuration that has to be converted into a platform specific one. This conversation is being done automatically by the build system (CMake) and thus does not cost us any time.

This allows us to support almost every operating system, as it was important for us the be platform independent. \\
The problem with platform dependent solutions is that they are not as accessible to everyone, and we really want to support all major operating systems to make our code and work as accessible as possible.
