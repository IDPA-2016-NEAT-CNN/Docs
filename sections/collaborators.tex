\subsection{Project Group}
Mr. Ferner thought of realizing this project quite a while ago.
Mr. Stucki, Mr. Fischler and Ms. Zarubica have found mutual interest in this topic and wanted to form a group meant to help Mr. Ferner to implement the idea.

Our motivation is to create something new together that can help people with their lives.
