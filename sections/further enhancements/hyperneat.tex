HypernNEAT is a further adjusted version, often also called an extension, of the original NEAT algorithm.\cite{Lowell2011}

HyperNEATs major problem is that it has performance hits compared to the original version of NEAT.
With that, the already performance flawed system of combining NEAT with CNNs would be too slow:
