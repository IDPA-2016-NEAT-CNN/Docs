We use automated testing to check each code change for issues. This means that the code everyone works on is located in a separate git branch \cite{gitbranch} and has to pass all integration tests before it gets merged into the main branch. A branch can be seen as a copy of the project that one works on in parallel to the original. When the work is done, the changes are copied over to the original version.

But before the changes can be added to the main branch, they have to pass our tests, which are basically dummy-programs that get executed on Travis and AppVeyor and require different parts of the software to work. This assures that we always have a stable version and improves code quality. \\
These tests are performed on remote servers and the status is visible on GitHub. \cite{githubci}

Travis and AppVeyor both use the same technology. They create a virtual machine to simulate a computer and run our software on that machine.
