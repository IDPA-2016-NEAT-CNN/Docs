We use automated testing to check each code change for issues. This means that the code everyone works on is located in a separate git branch \cite{gitbranch} and has to pass all integration tests before it gets merged into the main branch. This assures that we always have a stable version and improves code quality.

These tests are performed on remote servers and the status is visible on GitHub. \cite{githubci}
