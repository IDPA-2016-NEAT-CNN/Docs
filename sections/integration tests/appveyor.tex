Travis is a canadian service provider for automating integration tests on windows that can be found under https://ci.appveyor.com.

Appveyor also provides its services for free to open source projects. \cite{appveyorpricing} \\
We use it to compile and test our code on Windows with Visual Studio.

We struggled a lot with appveyor, because our Visual Studio configs were based on Visual Studio 2017 RC and they required this version to run.

However, when first used by us, Visual Studio 2017 RC was just released in closed beta as a pre-installation for continous integration. We had to get access to it by requesting for access through the public repository on github.

Once correctly configured however, we never had any problems with appveyor.
