Travis is a german service provider for automating integration tests that can be found under https://travis-ci.org/.

Travis offers its services for free to open source projects. \cite{travispricing} \\
We use it to compile and test our code on Linux. Travis also supports macOS, but since they both use the same compiler we chose to just use Linux.  

Travis also generates the PDF's for our documentation and warns us if a citation is missing a bibliography entry.
