 While working on our project we had to take our goals into account. So we found a lot oft them.  Here are our main goals.

1.	Read mammography correctly\\
2.	Probability indication to 95% \\
3.	Visual display\\
4.	Present the knowledge to the laity\\
5.	Reach platform independency\\

The ability to read mammography is very important because besides the project consisting of image recognition, it needs mammography too. Certainty is also really important for the project, and it puts a "stamp" on it because one has to be very sure before putting a cancer diagnose.\\
 A visual display is also a goal the project has, as it makes the use of the software easier and more appealing to the eye. A presentation for the laity could be a good supplement, providing them with the information they need, just to have a general clue. \\
 As a conclusion, our project should be softwate-independent with the purpose that one could be able to use it on any device.
