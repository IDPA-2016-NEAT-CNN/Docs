While working on our project we had to make us mind about our goals. So we found a lot oft them.  Here are our main goals.

1.	To read mammography\\
2.	Probability indication to 95% \\
3.	Visual display\\
4.	Presentation for laity\\
5.	Platform independet\\

To read mammography is for very important, because our project consists of it. And the probability is also very important, because you have too be very sure, before you say someone that there could be a chance that the person has cancer.\\
 A visual display is also a goal, since it makes the use of the software easier and more beautiful. A presentation for laity is also very important, because they can have insight how the software works. \\
 And at the end our software should be software independet, sine you should be able to use it on every device.
