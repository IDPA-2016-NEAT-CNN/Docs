The difficulty in evolving topologies lies in the way the topology is encoded in the genome. With traditional approaches the genomes cannot simply be combined, as they differ in size.

NEAT tries to solve this by using historical markings. Each connection receives a unique number, which is later used to group the networks in species. The more connections a network shares with another, the more related it is to that other network.
