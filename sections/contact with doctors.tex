After the planning, we were already beginning to look for doctors who could fit into our project. 
For this purpose, we exclusively sought doctors who were active in the field of oncology. 
The term oncology provides the work and referral with tumor diseases. 
Because our project is exclusively about breast mammography, we needed doctors which are specialized in the field of oncology in breast oncology.  
According to this categorization we therefore proceeded. 
After some research in the internet and also in books, we finally came to 26 doctors, which could be considered for our project. 
We have sent all the doctors a brief description of our project and explained to them the scope of the project.  Thereupon some emails came back. 
The most doctors have very much to do with research and therefore they just have limited time. 
We received a few appointments, which were unfortunately not in the time span of our project. 
Two doctors also sent us a study protocol request. 
This means as much as they requested from us a protocol, in which our project is structured in details. 
Hereupon we got to know about the study protocol and summarized one. 
This we sent the doctors. 
Dr. Serafino Forte of the hospital of Baden has invited us to the hospital after examining the study protocol. 
We talked to him about all the details in medical and organizational terms. At first he looked at our mammography record. Immediately he realized that our mammography’s are obsolete, because this technology is no longer needed. 
Our data was in the old format of the film-film system. This was good for our project on the one hand but also it was bad for our project on the other hand. 
It is definitely an advantage, because we have the possibility to have different mammography’s evaluated. 
With the outdated, as well as with the new and modern technology. 
However, it has a disadvantage. 
It is very difficult to get to the new mammography’s. Because we need a lot of mammography’s to train our software, we have to submit an ethics application. 
This is an even more detailed application than the study protocol by checking our project as trustworthy and possible. 
The application is examined by the Swiss Ethics Committees for Human Research. 
Also in this application the financial resources are examined and also the composition of the people. 
The financial resources are checked because the application is not free of charge. 
To submit an application, you have to pay a basic flat rate of 800.00 CHF. 
It is also checked at the check how the people are put together. 
This means that four individual persons as a team cannot carry out such a project because at the end of the project, it is a product, which is the result. 
Apart from the organizational, we have also looked at the medical aspects as mentioned. 
For Dr. Serafino Forte, it was also important that our software could not only tell you whether you have cancer, but also in which area you have cancer. 
Also the presentation should be divided into different colours, in order to facilitate the operation of the doctors.
