The currently available implementations of NEAT are suboptimal. \\
Most machine learning frameworks and libraries are focused on training by backpropagation and only offer limited support for genetic algorithms.

Dr. Stanley's original implementation in C++ \cite{Stanley2010} was written before the major revisions in the
C++ language, which made the language very different to use.\cite{Stroustrup2013}

The Code is no longer effectively usable, as it is ridden with experimental features, afterthoughts, dead code and patterns of thought that are no longer in use. \\
The most usable implementations are all written in python, which makes them very easy to use but also very slow when compared to optimized C++.

This is why in 2014 Mr. Ferner decided to work on an "actually usable" C++ implementation of NEAT,
which he called "Hippocrates".
