We didn't implement the ability for neurons to form recurrent connections, i.e. connect to previous layers. This feature is traditionally used to simulate short-term memory in e.g. speech recognition, where one word alters the meaning of another. \cite{HasimSak2014}  

As our images are not sequentially interconnected (as e.g. in a movie), we do not need this.
