For our work we used some platforms and programs. The most important of these are: Visual Studio, LaTex and Github.\\

\subsection {Visual Studio}

Visual Studio is a programming tool. We have programmed all of our software in Visual Studio and worked with it. Since Visual Studio is very modern, it has supported us very well with our project changes. And changes to the software structure were not too difficult.

\subsection {LaTex}

We used LaTex as our documentation tool. We have written and designed all our documentation in LaTex. The advantages of LaTex are that LaTex is platform-independet, which means it can be used on any device. Special formulas can also be used and it takes over the entire formatting, so we donâ€™t have to care us about it.

\subsection {Github}

We used github as an online platform. At github you can work together on projects and view other projects. You can also give other people tasks or demand a review of a task. Github is and was a very big help for our project, beause it gave us an overview of the programming. It gaves us also security, because every job was looked by a Review of another member and was checked. 
At github you can also make branchs. A branch is a copy of a project. A branch offers additional security to the programmer, because if you make changes to the original project, it can be that this no longer works. On the other hand, if you work on the branch you cannot destroy anything. 
A change and editings in the branch can, of course be inputted in the original project, if it is in order. Since our project was public on github, people who had no idea about it, but were interested in it, could take a look at it. 
Also specialists in our area could look at our program and give us tips. Github has many advantages and offers the user many possibilities.
