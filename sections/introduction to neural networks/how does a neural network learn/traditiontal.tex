The traditional approach of optimizing the connection weigths to improve the network's accuracy is named backpropagation.

\begin{quote}
\emph{"The Backpropagation algorithm is a supervised learning method for multilayer feed-forward networks from the field of Artificial Neural Networks. }

\emph{Feed-forward neural networks are inspired by the information processing of one or more neural cells, called a neuron. A neuron accepts input signals via its dendrites, which pass the electrical signal down to the cell body. The axon carries the signal out to synapses, which are the connections of a cell’s axon to other cell’s dendrites."} \cite{backprop_from_scratch}

Backpropagation uses mathematical approaches to calculate changes to the weights of its connections, so that the output becomes more accurate every time the weights are updated.
